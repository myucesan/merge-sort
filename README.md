# Merge Sort

**Note that this implementation is unfinished. **
This exercise is inspired by ADS and meant to get you reacquainted with a slightly more involved version of recursion.

In this exercise you are tasked with implementing Mergesort, as an example of a Divide & Conquer algorithm. The method sort takes an array of integers as input and sorts the provided array.
